# ðŸ¦€ Reji's Rave ðŸ¦€

I made this game beacuse I wanted to try out react-three-fiber. I also wanted to finish a full game since the other games I have been working on are more complex and far from finished, so I tried keeping this one simpler, but I might return to it and add more features later.

Reji is a crab who loves to rave! Help him collect shells while avoiding the tide (he's scared of water...). If you accumulate enough shells you can request the DJ to play Reji's favorite song.


## How to Play

- **Movement**: Reji walks towards your mouse as it moves around
- **Collect Shells**: Walk over shells to collect them
- **Avoid Drowning**: Stay out of the water as the tide rises, if Reji loses all his health he passes out until the tide goes down
- **Rave Mode**: Enter the rave by paying 50 shells

## This game uses:

- **React** - UI framework
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics library
- **React Three Fiber** - React renderer for Three.js
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**
- **Zustand** - State management
- **GLB Models** - 3D assets


**Future ideas:**
- Add new shell types with different values
- Add power-ups (speed, waterproof, grow, idk)
- Add obstacles on the beach (rocks, sharks, sandcastles)
- Add multiplayer features
- Add tiers of rave modes to reward higher scores
